1.)  This command:    "build": "netlify deploy --prod",     should be placed in the package json folder to build the and deploy on netlify

2.) this comand:     "start": "netlify-lambda serve src" , starts the server locally. so in order for it to work, you must have ann src folder and add the same code in it.

3.) if you don't need to test locally, you don't nee an src file.
